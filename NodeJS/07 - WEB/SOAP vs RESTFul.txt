What is the difference between SOAP and REST?

Soap Advantages
SOAP provides the following advantages when compared to REST:
•    Language, platform, and transport independent (REST requires use of HTTP)
•    Works well in distributed enterprise environments (REST assumes direct point-to-point communication)
•    Standardized
•    Provides significant pre-build extensibility in the form of the WS* standards
•    Built-in error handling
•    Automation when used with certain language products

REST Advantages
REST is easier to use for the most part and is more flexible. It has the following advantages over SOAP:
•    No expensive tools require to interact with the web service
•    Smaller learning curve
•    Efficient (SOAP uses XML for all messages, REST can use smaller message formats)
•    Fast (no extensive processing required)
•    Closer to other web technologies in design philosophy
