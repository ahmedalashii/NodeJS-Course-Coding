Before the web, the internet existed as a collection of interconnected networks used primarily for research, academic, and military purposes. People could connect to these networks through terminal-based applications and protocols, such as Telnet and FTP, to access and share information.

After the creation of the web, the internet transformed into a more user-friendly and accessible platform, allowing people to easily access and share information using web browsers and standardized protocols such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). 
The web revolutionized the way we interact with information and with each other, enabling us to communicate, conduct business, and access information more easily and quickly.

The web also gave rise to new technologies and innovations such as social media, e-commerce, and cloud computing, which have transformed our lives in numerous ways. The web continues to evolve, with advancements in technologies such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and the Internet of Things (IoT), promising to reshape the way we interact with the digital world.
