- What's Node.js?
   1- Node.js is a JavaScript framework built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. 
   2- Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. 
   3- Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
   4- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
   5- Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side 
      to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
   6- Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications.
   7- Node.js is single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive 
      real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

- Node.js Features:
   1- Asynchronous and Event Driven
   2- Very Fast
   3- Single Threaded but Highly Scalable
   4- No Buffering
   5- License
   6- Uses Google's V8 JavaScript Engine
   7- File System Module
   8- HTTP Module
   9- Events Module
   10- Supports a lot of libraries >> Node Package Manager (NPM) is a huge ecosystem of open source libraries..
   11- Supports both server-side and client-side development.
   12- Supports async programming.
   13- Real-time applications. >> Socket IO >> Web Sockets >> Like Chatting, Video Conferencing, etc.

- Single-threading vs Multi-threading:
   Single-threading is a programming model where only one thread of execution exists in the program.
   Multi-threading is a programming model where two or more threads of execution can exist within a program.


- Node.js Dependencies:
   1- ECMAScript (ES) It's a standard that defines the core of JavaScript. Others: TypeScript, CoffeeScript, etc.
                     Example of ES6: let, const, arrow functions, classes, etc.
   2- CommonJS Module >> CommonJS Module: It's specalized for importing and exporting modules in JavaScript.
   3- V8 Engine (Sync execution) (Single-Thread => V8 Call Stack) >> It's a JavaScript engine that is used in Google Chrome and in Node.js (Code execution Manager => Runner).
   4- Libuv (Async execution =>> Async handler >> Multi-thread) >> It's a cross-platform asynchronous I/O library. It usually came with 4 threads.
   5- NPM (Node Package Manager) >> It's a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. >> Dependency manager like Composer in PHP.



- Node.js Server:
   Node.js has a built-in module called HTTP, which allows Node.js to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
   http package is a package for creating a server and listening to requests and responses
   Declaring a server in Node.js is very simple. We just need to use the createServer() method of the HTTP module inside the Node.js application.
